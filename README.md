# A Fighting Chance

Image

A Fighting Chance is a Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game but with a Monty Python and the Holy Grail Theme, which in itself is also an extension of the classic game of chance, Rock Paper Scissors. Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock was mentioned in *The Times* of London in 2005 and was later the subject of an episode of the American sitcom *The Big Bang Theory* in 2008, and *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* is a British comedy movie made in 1975.

This website is originally supposed to be a mobile game where the Black Knight (from the movie) challenges you to the Mobile game itself, in vengance after loosing to King Arthur in the movie. You will see (on bigger screens) the Black Knight facing you off for the challenege with your phone infront of you depicting the scene of what is happeneing. The game itself is a game of pure chance where you choose your desired Knight and the Black Knight (computer) chooses a random Knight. From the specific rules of the game, one will beat the other or end in a draw. You also have the option to choose your name before the game begins.

### Color Scheme

![Color scheme image](assets/readme-files/color-scheme.png)

The colors used in the site are white (#ffffff) for the navigation bar, slides background and some hover effects, a tone of orange (#bf834a) for closing buttons and buttons' hover effect, a tone of green (#789053) for the background and buttons, a blue color (#344b99) and a dark color (#151311) for the text.

The colors scheme is inspired on the game's main image. This way each color represents the 5 different weapons (rock, paper, scissors, lizard and Spock) used in the game.

### Typography

The main font used in the site is Nunito, as suggested by Google Fonts for appropriate pairings with Odibee Sans, with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case Nunito is not being imported correctly. Odibee Sans is used for the headings and the logo for the gaming design it provides with Cursive as fallback.
