A Fighting Chance is a Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game but with a Monty Python and the Holy Grail Theme, which in itself is also an extension of the classic game of chance, Rock Paper Scissors. Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock was mentioned in *The Times* of London in 2005 and was later the subject of an episode of the American sitcom *The Big Bang Theory* in 2008, and *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* is a British comedy movie made in 1975.

This website is originally supposed to be a mobile game where the Black Knight (from the movie) challenges you to the Mobile game itself, in vengance after loosing to King Arthur in the movie. You will see (on bigger screens) the Black Knight facing you off for the challenege with your phone infront of you depicting the scene of what is happeneing. The game itself is a game of pure chance where you choose your desired Knight and the Black Knight (computer) chooses a random Knight, and from the specific rules of the game, one will beat the other or end in a draw. You also have the option to choose your name before the game begins.
