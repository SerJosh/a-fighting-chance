# A Fighting Chance

![A Fighting Chance on different divices](assets/readme-files/readme-main.png)

A Fighting Chance is a Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game but with a Monty Python and the Holy Grail Theme, which in itself is also an extension of the classic game of chance, Rock Paper Scissors. Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock was mentioned in *The Times* of London in 2005 and was later the subject of an episode of the American sitcom *The Big Bang Theory* in 2008, and *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* is a British comedy movie made in 1975.

This website is originally supposed to be a mobile game where the Black Knight (from the movie) challenges you to the Mobile game itself, in vengance after loosing to King Arthur in the movie. You will see (on bigger screens) the Black Knight facing you off for the challenege with your phone infront of you depicting the scene of what is happeneing. The game itself is a game of pure chance where you choose your desired Knight and the Black Knight (computer) chooses a random Knight. From the specific rules of the game, one will beat the other or end in a draw. You also have the option to choose your name before the game begins.

- As a player, I want to have easy access to be informed on how to play.

- As a player, I want to have easy access to know more about the game.

### Color Scheme

![Color scheme image](assets/readme-files/color-scheme2.png)

The colors used in the site are black (#000000) and Forest/dark green (0C952A). It is a contrast of colours used throughout the Game, where the dark green is used for the buttons and hover effects and Black used for the background of the phone to make the other colours stand out. And of course all text in the colour of White (#FFFFFF) to stand out from the black used in the background.

The colors scheme is inspired by the forest where the battle of the Black Knight and King Arthur took place.

### Typography

The Fonts used are Pirata One, Barlow Semi Condensed and sans-serif which I chose myself. Pirata One was used in all headings for the medieval vibe in which the theme of the movie the game used took place, Barlow Semi Condensed used for the text in the Game for its simplicity and clarity and sans-serif used as back up if the others are unable to come up.

### Wireframes

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) has been used to plan a structure of the appearance of the site and display the placement of the different elements in the game.

![Landing Page section wireframe image](assets/readme-files/wireframe1.png)
![Game Page wireframe image](assets/readme-files/wireframe2.png)

Obviously as you can see, the finished game does not look too much like the wireframes anymore. It was more of a guideline for how I originally wanted it to look in my head, and as i developed the project new and improved ideas came to me and I adjusted it accordingly.

## Testing

### Testing User Stories

- As a player, I want the game to be easy to navigate.

  - A section slide design has been used to move across the different sections of the game with ease.

  - The game offers a simple design and structure of easy to read buttons for the player to find information or a section they are looking for.

- As a player, I want the game to be fun and engaging.

  - An image of the Black Knight facing you off behind your phone screen (750px +)  has been used to represent the context of game in a fun way, and also to kill off a lot of reponsive design work.

  - The game's colour design has been used to contrast all readable information from a black background, creating clarity among text content, buttons and images.

  - The game page displays the Knights chosen by both the player and the opponent in their respective left and right location, with a VS between them.

  - The score for the game is being tracked and displayed at the bottom of the selectted Knights and result, between two lines so seperate the other information from the score.

  - A Knight choice area is displayed at the bottom of the screen, clearly displaying the Knights you can use in the game.  

  - A name input area is available for the player to put their desired name in (10 characters long) to use in the game, ofcourse this can be skipped if desired.

- As a player, I want to be able to access the games social media sites with ease

  - A footer section which is at the bottom of the Landing Page is displayed, with all the games platforms availabe and open when clicked.

### Code Validation

- The [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) platform was used to validate the project in order to ensure there were no syntax errors.

![HTML errors](assets/readme-files/html-validate-1.png)

![HTML errors](assets/readme-files/html-validate-2.png)

![HTML errors](assets/readme-files/html-validate-3.png)

![HTML errors](assets/readme-files/html-validate-4.png)

 W3C Markup Validator returned a series of minor errors easily mendable.

- **HTML Bug fixes**

 Three of the errors with additional warnings were of duplicate ids used through the project, so a simple process of changing them to classes and also changing them to classes in the CSS was done. A very small error of a / not being used in an H2 element caused multiple errors and when rectified solved 3 errors in itself, and lastly there was a stray div at the bottom of the HTML code which I removed.

- The [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) platform was used to validate the project in order to ensure there were no syntax errors.

![CSS errors](assets/readme-files/css-validate-1.png)

The W3C CSS Validator returned 4 simple errors all to do with the same thing.

- **CSS Bug fixes**
  
A simple process of removing the linear gradient used in multiple occurances in the CSS solved all the problems

- The [JSHints JavaScript Code Quality Tool](https://jshint.com/) was used validate the site's JavaScript code.

![JavaScript errors](assets/readme-files/js-validate-1.png)

JSHint returned one undefined variable and three unused variables. The undefined variable was just a misspelling of window, where there as no W. And as for the three unused variables, it was because they were onclick functions for inner HTML code that i assume was not read yet, therefore I removed most of my innerHTML code from my Javascript and instead on onclick code in my HTML, i used eventListners in my Javascript, listening for ids in buttons, this removed all the unused variables. There was also one console issue with the name of an onclick function of PlayerName() which i have removed.

### Accessibility

- Used Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools to confirm that the colors and fonts being used in throughout the website are easy to read and accessible.

- Lighthouse reports

  - **index.html**
  
  ![Lighthouse report](assets/readme-files/lighthouse.png)

### Tools Testing

- [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)

  - Chrome DevTools was used during the development process of the project to test, modify HTML elements and CSS styles, test responsiveness and see if the Javascript did what it needed to in the project.

- Responsiveness

  - [Am I Responsive?](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/#) was used to check responsiveness of the game across different devices.

### Known Bugs

 There are several thing I have noticed throughout the creation of the project, they are not obvious errors but they are there and I would have liked to improve them if not for time constraints.
  
   1. The phone screen when displayed on bigger screens is much higher that I wanted, I wanted it to be more in the center.

   2. The section slides go though other pages, giving you a brief (and i mean very brief) glimps of other pages as you go down the HTML code.

   3. When accessing the About the Game section from the Landing page, you do see the brief glimpses of other pages, but there is also a tiny little jump if you look carefully whilst going to that page.

   4. The scrolling length and the awkward length of the Black Knight background image when displayed on smaller divices is also an issue of mine.

   5. Landscape mode can be accessed on mobile devices, which distort the game on the phone.

   6. When I was playing on the phone, I found I could scroll with my finger to other pages of the game, it might be useful..maybe.. but I originally didnt want that to happen.

   7. I did not Know how to vaildate the inner HTML in the Javascript code, but everything seems to be working just fine.
