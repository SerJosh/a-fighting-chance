# A Fighting Chance

Image

A Fighting Chance is a Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game but with a Monty Python and the Holy Grail Theme, which in itself is also an extension of the classic game of chance, Rock Paper Scissors. Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock was mentioned in *The Times* of London in 2005 and was later the subject of an episode of the American sitcom *The Big Bang Theory* in 2008, and *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* is a British comedy movie made in 1975.

This website is originally supposed to be a mobile game where the Black Knight (from the movie) challenges you to the Mobile game itself, in vengance after loosing to King Arthur in the movie. You will see (on bigger screens) the Black Knight facing you off for the challenege with your phone infront of you depicting the scene of what is happeneing. The game itself is a game of pure chance where you choose your desired Knight and the Black Knight (computer) chooses a random Knight. From the specific rules of the game, one will beat the other or end in a draw. You also have the option to choose your name before the game begins.

### Color Scheme

![Color scheme image](assets/readme-files/color-scheme2.png)

The colors used in the site are black (#000000) and Forest/dark green (0C952A). It is a contrast of colours used throughout the Game, where the dark green is used for the buttons and hover effects and Black used for the background of the phone to make the other colours stand out. And of course all text in the colour of White (#FFFFFF) to stand out from the black used in the background.

The colors scheme is inspired by the forest where the battle of the Black Knight and King Arthur took place.

### Typography

The Fonts used are Pirata One, Barlow Semi Condensed and sans-serif which I chose myself. Pirata One was used in all headings for the medieval vibe in which the theme of the movie the game used took place, Barlow Semi Condensed used for the text in the Game for its simplicity and clarity and sans-serif used as back up if the others are unable to come up.

### Wireframes

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) has been used to plan a structure of the appearance of the site and display the placement of the different elements in the game.

![Landing Page section wireframe image](assets/readme-files/wireframe1.png)
![Game Page wireframe image](assets/readme-files/wireframe2.png)

Obviously as you can see, the finished game does not look too much like the wireframes anymore. It was more of a guideline for how I originally wanted it to look in my head, and as i developed the project new and improved ideas came to me and I adjusted it accordingly.
